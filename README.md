This is an unfinished planet platformer game on iOS, using cocos2d-x. I'm not sure if I'll continue working on it or not.

The game features a simple but robust planet gravity based on Box2D. 

It also has a framework for built-in game editor that uses iOS UI and interoperate with cocos2d-x in C++.
